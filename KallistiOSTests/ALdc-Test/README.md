This is just my own way of setting up ALdc with a copy of the "basic" sample from the ALdc repo. Here's how it works

- Run the `add-ALdc-2-kos-ports.sh` script which adds ALdc as a KOS port so you can use it anywhere in your system
- Run `make` to build the basic sample

Also note some of the ALdc demos feature graphics using GLdc. In order to setup that as a KOS port run `add-GLdc-2-kos-ports.sh`
